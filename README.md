Make School Web 1.0: Custom Calculator Project

This project is a compound interest calculator created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user enters the principal amount, the interest rate percentage, the total amount of time, and the number of times that the interest is compounded per unit time (such as 2 times per year). The default unit for the time is Years, but the user can select other units (Years, Months, or Days) using the drop-down menu. If the time entered is 1, then the units in the drop-down menu automatically change to the singular form (Year, Month, and Day). If the user changes the time units, then the prompt for the number of times that the interest is compounded per unit time is automatically adjusted to the selected time unit. Since the default time unit is years, it usually reads "Number of times interest is compounded per year", but that will change to "Number of times interest is compounded per month" or "Number of times interest is compounded per day" if the selected units are "Months" or "Days", respectively.
